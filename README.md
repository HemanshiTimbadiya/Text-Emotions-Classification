# Text-Emotions-Classification


## Description
The Text Classifier is a machine learning project focused on classifying textual data into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project leverages various NLP methods alongside machine learning algorithms to effectively process and analyze text data, achieving accurate classification results.

## Objectives
Develop a robust text classification model that accurately categorizes text documents.

Utilize advanced NLP techniques for effective text preprocessing, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization.

Evaluate and compare the performance of different classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks).

Create an intuitive interface for users to input text and receive classification predictions.

## Features
Text Preprocessing: Implement NLP techniques to clean and prepare text data, including:

Tokenization

Removing stop words and punctuation

Stemming and lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization

Model Training: Train and evaluate multiple classification models, using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User Interface: A simple command-line or web interface for users to input text and receive classification results.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:

scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical computations

nltk or spaCy for NLP processing

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

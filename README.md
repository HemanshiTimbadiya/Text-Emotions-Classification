# Text-Emotions-Classification


## Description
The Text Classifier is a machine learning project focused on classifying textual data into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project leverages various NLP methods alongside machine learning algorithms to effectively process and analyze text data, achieving accurate classification results.

## Objectives
Develop a robust text classification model that accurately categorizes text documents.

Utilize advanced NLP techniques for effective text preprocessing, such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization.

Evaluate and compare the performance of different classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks).

Create an intuitive interface for users to input text and receive classification predictions.

## Features
Text Preprocessing: Implement NLP techniques to clean and prepare text data, including:

Tokenization

Removing stop words and punctuation

Stemming and lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization

## Model Training:
Train a deep learning model and track:

Training Accuracy

Validation Accuracy

Training Loss

Validation Loss

Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the metrics over epochs for better understanding of model performance.

User Interface: A simple command-line or web interface for users to input text and receive classification results.

## Technologies Used
